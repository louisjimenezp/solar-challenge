# Planet Guidelines

## Scope
- Domain: Solar technical challenge productization.
- In scope: challenge strategy, scope definition, implementation planning, deliverables (demo/repo/README), and decision logs specific to this challenge.
- Out of scope: unrelated personal career tasks, Uhorizon client operations, or framework-level governance changes in `core/` unless explicitly requested.

## Governance
- Required checks: every proposed change must map to at least one challenge evaluation criterion (problem-solving, full-stack fundamentals, AI usage, code quality, decision clarity, UX/product thinking).
- Security/data rules: do not expose secrets, API keys, or private user data in demos, repo history, or documentation.
- Operational limits: keep scope within a 6-8 hour build budget unless user explicitly extends scope.
